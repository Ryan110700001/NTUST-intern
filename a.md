### 6G Architecture for Enabling Predictable, Reliable and Deterministic Networks: The PREDICT6G Case-----

### üèóÔ∏è Overall Architecture
The architecture is composed of **two main pillars**:
#### 1. AICP - AI-driven Inter-domain Control Plane
- Based on **service-based architecture**
- Organizes network management through **Management Services (MS)** grouped into **Management Domains (MD)**
- Supports E2E deterministic service orchestration, SLA assurance, and failure mitigation
- Integrates multi-domain networks (3GPP, DetNet, IEEE TSN, etc.)
#### 2. MDP - Multi-Domain Data Plane
- A ‚Äúsmart user-plane‚Äù with programmable data and control mechanisms
- Supports TSN, DetNet, and integrates with multiple standards
- Enables reliable and predictable data forwarding across domains

### l Implementation Challenges

#### 1. AI/ML Model Deployment and Placement
- **Section III.A.2** discusses AI model orchestration across the **RIC, edge, and centralized cloud** layers.
- Introduces **OrchestRAN**, a platform for optimizing AI placement.
- Emphasizes **context-aware placement** based on data availability, privacy, latency, and bandwidth.

#### 2. Inference Delay and Resource Optimization
- Highlights trade-offs between **low latency edge inference** and **higher-accuracy centralized inference**.
- Discusses **service reliability vs. resource efficiency** trade-offs.
- Introduces **intelligent agents (IAs)** to manage lifecycle and optimize inference delay.

#### 3. Memory and Compute Constraints
- Proposes **modular model design** where unnecessary modules are pruned to reduce memory footprint.
- Advocates for **model retraining based on drift types** (sudden, gradual, incremental, recurring).

#### 4. Edge/Cloud Deployment Trade-offs
- Details **pros and cons** of deploying intelligence at:
  - Edge: low latency, high privacy, limited compute
  - Cloud: high capacity, increased delay, central control
- Calls for **hybrid orchestration** strategies based on system dynamics.

#### 5. Training Data & Real-World Data Collection
