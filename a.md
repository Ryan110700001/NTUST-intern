### 6G Architecture for Enabling Predictable, Reliable and Deterministic Networks: The PREDICT6G Case-----

### üèóÔ∏è Overall Architecture
The architecture is composed of **two main pillars**:
#### 1. AICP - AI-driven Inter-domain Control Plane
- Based on **service-based architecture**
- Organizes network management through **Management Services (MS)** grouped into **Management Domains (MD)**
- Supports E2E deterministic service orchestration, SLA assurance, and failure mitigation
- Integrates multi-domain networks (3GPP, DetNet, IEEE TSN, etc.)
#### 2. MDP - Multi-Domain Data Plane
- A ‚Äúsmart user-plane‚Äù with programmable data and control mechanisms
- Supports TSN, DetNet, and integrates with multiple standards
- Enables reliable and predictable data forwarding across domains

### ü§ñ AI/ML Integration

#### AI-Enabled Functional Components:
- **AI/ML Resource Orchestrator**: Manages computational and networking resources
- **Learning Orchestrator**: Manages model training within domains
- **Dataset & Model Registries**: Metadata management for models and datasets
- **Digital Twin (DT)**: Supports real-time simulation and predictive analysis

These components enable:
- Proactive SLA monitoring
- Cross-domain adaptation
- Self-healing and intelligent fault recovery

### üåê Multi-Domain Operation
The architecture supports seamless integration across:
- **3GPP domains**: using NEF for configuration and automation
- **DetNet domains**: via path computation, topology exposure
- **IEEE TSN domains**: for time synchronization and deterministic flows

Each domain provides **technology-agnostic APIs** to ensure interoperability while maintaining domain-specific implementations internally.

## üîß Challenges Addressed

- **Extension to non-deterministic domains**: Optional modules can be deployed to enhance legacy domains with deterministic capabilities.
- **5G‚Äì6G transition**: PREDICT-6G provides a pathway to upgrade 5G systems by layering deterministic and AI-enhanced capabilities.
