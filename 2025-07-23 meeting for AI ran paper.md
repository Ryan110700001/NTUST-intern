- *Topic*: AI RAM Research Paper Outline and Literature Review
- *Summary*:  
  The team reviewed key literature‐search strategies for the AI RAM paper, including survey and use‑case sources from academic groups (e.g. Northeastern University, Urekom) and industry alliances (Orin Alliance, Nvidia). Standardization efforts (A1, E2, Air1, SMEO) and proposed architectures integrating AI into SMO assemblies were discussed. Participants examined module toolkits (OC Lab, Nvidia Omniverse/SH RT) and explored application scenarios like energy‑saving apps, real‑time traffic prediction, and digital twins. Emphasis was placed on maintaining logical flow between sections, proper citation practices, and marking revisions for review. Next steps include detailed section drafting, weekly lab meetings, and milestone scheduling around upcoming exams.
- *Discussion Points*:
  - **Literature Search**:  
    • Seek AI RAM survey papers and use‑case studies (e.g., Jinong’s posts, Northeastern University open‑architecture work, Urekom’s large‑scale AI survey).  
    • Evaluate citations count and trace original ideas for accurate referencing.  
  - **Standardization & Interfaces**:  
    • Define core interfaces: A1, E2 (basic SMO), Air1 (app‑to‑app communication), SMEO (surface mgmt & exposure).  
    • Align module data formats and interface standards with 3GPP specs.  
  - **Architecture Proposals**:  
    • Integrate AI into SMO assembly (AI SMO) with workload interfaces and standard connectors.  
    • Illustrate end‑to‑end flow: RU → DU (high/low) → CU → SMO → 5G Core → Internet.  
  - **Toolkits & Modules**:  
    • Prioritize OC Lab frameworks, then Nvidia SDKs (Omniverse, SH RT).  
    • Explore additional toolkits (e.g., Qualcomm) and justify inclusion based on flexibility and vendor support.  
  - **Use Cases & Applications**:  
    • Energy‑saving apps (idle shutdown via RF load monitoring).  
    • Traffic‑prediction apps (seasonal vs. semester vs. holiday behavior).  
    • Digital‑twin integration for real‑time simulation and network‑environment coupling.  
  - **Paper Structure & Citations**:  
    • Maintain section flow and avoid duplication.  
    • Insert citations (journal papers, white papers with document numbers) at least once per paragraph.  
    • Mark all revisions for easy review by professors.  
  - **Scheduling & Collaboration**:  
    • Weekly lab meetings (Wednesdays/Fridays) and special sessions around exams.  
    • Join FMO group for progress updates and shared resources.  
- *Action Items*:
  - [ ] Search for and compile key AI RAM survey and use‑case papers.  
  - [ ] Draft “Interface Standards” section covering A1, E2, Air1, SMEO.  
  - [ ] Create AI‑SMO assembly architecture diagram.  
  - [ ] Build a comparison table of AI toolkits (OC Lab vs. Nvidia vs. others).  
  - [ ] Upload the audio transcript to the shared notebook.  
  - [ ] Post weekly progress update by Friday.  
  - [ ] Schedule next follow‑up meeting around the exam timetable.
